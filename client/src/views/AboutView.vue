        <p class="content">That's okay. This web app is about exercise and tracking your progress. 
          I don't know what to put here, and I think there should be an about page too so I have not deleted it yet.
          Once logged in, users are able to enter in workouts and this app will be able to calculate a couple of things for you, even swapping between two measurement systems! 
          How neat.</p>
